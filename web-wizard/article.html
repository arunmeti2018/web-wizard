                        their children can access and do on their mobile devices. This can include blocking apps,
                        websites, and content, as well as setting screen time limits and monitoring activity.
                        App blocking: Parents have the option to prevent a certain set of apps from being downloaded or

                    <h3>Information overload</h3>
                    <p> Identify your sources. Not all information is created equal. It is important to be able to
                        identify credible sources of information.
                        Be skeptical. Don't believe everything you read or see. Evaluate information critically and ask
                        yourself if it makes sense.
                        Take your time. There is no need to rush to consume information. Take your time to read,
                        understand, and reflect on the information that you are exposed to.
                        Don't be afraid to say no. It is okay to say no to information that you don't have time for or
                        that you don't need.
                        Take breaks. It is important to take breaks from information consumption. Get up and move
                        around, or do something else that you enjoy.</p>
